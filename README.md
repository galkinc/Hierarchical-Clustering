# Hierarchical-Clustering
Hierarchical Clustering using Euclidean Distance for viral cDNA genome

# Objectives
In this project, we are going to focus on three learning objectives:
* Locate and process the viral cDNA genome files to calculate the skew profiles.
* Use different methods to build linkage matrices, and evaluate different approaches to construct meaningful hierarchical clusters
* Analyze and understand the results dendrograms
